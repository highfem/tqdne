# The noteboos is stored as Python file using `jupytext` to avoid faulty `ipynb` files (which typically arise when multiple people collaborate on notebooks on GitHub). To run the Python file as notebook,
#
# - start `jupyter lab` from the command line,
# - then open the Python file as notebook ('right-click' + 'open with'in Jupyter lab).
